# Rustracing
Made using the Rust version of the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley, Translated to Rust-Lang by Daniel Bush. https://github.com/misterdanb
# Book:

Did it to learn about rust :) Thanks to Daniel Bush for the translation and thanks to Peter Shirley for the original book on first place.
